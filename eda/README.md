### Exploratory data analysis 

Some EDA work will be done directly on BigQuery. Demo notebooks will explore some basic information. 
The first notebook is heavily inspired by the great work by the [Datathon](https://github.com/MIT-LCP/sccm-datathon) folks!

Will be exploring the following data relationships: 

*  Patients demographics on survival, mortality, disease progression 
*  Patients length of stay based on disease and demographics
